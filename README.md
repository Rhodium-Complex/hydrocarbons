# Molecular Generator Program
This Python program is designed to enumerate molecules composed of carbon and hydrogen. It allows users to input a specific molecular formula and checks whether the given formula is composed of carbon and hydrogen.

## Key Features
Simple Input: Input any chemical formula, and the program checks if it comprises carbon and hydrogen.
Flexibility: Handles various molecules for validation.
Clear Output: Provides explicit indication if the molecule is composed of carbon and hydrogen.
## Novelty
This implementation aims to fill the gap in the comprehensive enumeration of hydrocarbons. Despite the significant interest in hydrocarbon enumeration, there's a lack of comprehensive databases or programs addressing this, making this one of the initial implementations in this domain.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
1. View the displayed result.
## Language and Libraries Used
Python 3
Primarily utilizes standard libraries.
## Important Note
This program conducts a basic verification of the input molecule. It is not suitable for advanced chemical evaluations or in-depth structural analysis.

** Disclaimer **: The use of this program is for reference purposes only. It does not guarantee chemical accuracy.
